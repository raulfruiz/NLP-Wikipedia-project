# NLP-Wikipedia-project


## Overview
This repo aims to show a detailed step by step scripting of how a database of Wikipedia profiles
was taken and analyzed in order to train an ML model capable of doing NLP.

## What is specifically this model capable of?
The script can open and read a .csv file containing more than 40 thousand Wikipedia profiles from remarkable
people of variety of fields and backgrounds.

It receives as parameter the name of one of those persons and returns the name of the 10 most-alike profiles.

All achieved by using Scikitlearn, Pandas and Numpy algorithms special for numerical and statistical anaylisis.

Feel free to reach me if you have any doubt or comment about how the model can be improved. I'll be glad to read you ðŸ˜„
